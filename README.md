# Reactions interfaces source code

**These two interfaces were developed for the 'Reactions' poetry installation, using the work of the poet Christy Ducker. Each creates a different animated interactive display from the poem text.**



### Content

This code repository contains the HTML and JS file for the 'Baffle' and 'Meanwhile' reading interfaces,  the code for which can be found in the respective folders .

'Baffle' slowly reveals the text, with the words growing from randomly selected starting points. Clicking/tapping by the user can create new starting point and speed the process along.

'Meanwhile' divides each line of text into two halves, a left and a right. The user can then use the 'down' and 'right' keys to progress through the text, dictating which parts of each line are revealed.

The poems in these interface have been replaced with placeholder text, which is clearly marked in the  HTML and JS files.
